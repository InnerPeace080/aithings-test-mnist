# ONNX: Open Neural Network Exchange

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open standard for representing machine learning models. It enables models trained in one framework (like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn) to be exported and used in another, making deployment and interoperability easier.

---

## 1. Why ONNX?

- **Interoperability:** Move models between frameworks and platforms (e.g., train in PyTorch, deploy in C++ or on edge devices).
- **Deployment:** Use ONNX models in production environments, including cloud, mobile, and embedded systems.
- **Optimization:** ONNX Runtime can optimize models for speed and efficiency on various hardware (CPU, GPU, FPGA, etc.).

---

## 2. ONNX Model Structure

An ONNX model is stored in a `.onnx` file, which contains:

- The computation graph (layers, operations, connections)
- Model weights and parameters
- Input and output specifications

ONNX uses a protocol buffer (protobuf) format for efficient serialization and portability.

## 3. Exporting a PyTorch Model to ONNX

You can export a trained PyTorch model to ONNX using `torch.onnx.export()`:

```python
import torch
import torch.onnx

# Assume 'model' is your trained PyTorch model
# 'dummy_input' is a tensor with the same shape as your model's input

torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx", 
                  input_names=['input'], output_names=['output'], 
                  opset_version=11)
```

- `dummy_input` is required to trace the model's computation graph.
- `opset_version` specifies the ONNX operator set (version 11 is widely supported).

---

## 4. Loading and Running ONNX Models

ONNX models can be loaded and run using ONNX Runtime:

```python
import onnxruntime as ort

session = ort.InferenceSession("model.onnx")
inputs = {session.get_inputs()[0].name: input_array}
outputs = session.run(None, inputs)
```

- ONNX Runtime supports fast inference on CPU, GPU, and other hardware.
- You can use ONNX models in Python, C++, Java, and more.

## 5. Supported Frameworks and Tools

- **PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn:** Can export models to ONNX.
- **ONNX Runtime:** For fast, cross-platform inference.
- **Converters:** Tools exist to convert models from other formats (e.g., CoreML, XGBoost) to ONNX.

## 7. Why Model Accuracy May Drop After ONNX Conversion

You may notice a slight decrease in model accuracy after converting to ONNX. Common reasons include:

1. **Operator Differences:** Some PyTorch or TensorFlow operations are not exactly replicated in ONNX, leading to small numerical differences.
2. **Precision Loss:** ONNX may use different data types or lower precision (e.g., float32 vs float64), causing minor accuracy drops.
3. **Unsupported Layers:** Custom or less common layers may be approximated or replaced during export, affecting results.
4. **Export Mode:** If the model is exported in training mode instead of evaluation mode (`model.eval()`), layers like dropout or batch normalization behave differently.
5. **Dynamic vs Static Shapes:** ONNX may handle dynamic shapes or batch sizes differently, affecting inference.
6. **Post-processing:** Some post-processing steps (e.g., softmax, argmax) may be handled differently in ONNX Runtime.

These differences are usually small, but for critical applications, always validate ONNX output against the original framework and adjust export settings or model code if needed.

- Not all operations in every framework are supported by ONNX; check compatibility before exporting.
- Some custom layers or models may require additional conversion steps.
- ONNX is best for feedforward, convolutional, and many standard architectures; very new or custom ops may not be supported.

## 7. Example Workflow

1. Train a model in PyTorch.
2. Export to ONNX with `torch.onnx.export()`.
3. Load and run the model in ONNX Runtime for fast inference.
4. Deploy the ONNX model to cloud, mobile, or edge devices.
