# ONNX: Open Neural Network Exchange

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open standard for representing machine learning models. It enables models trained in one framework (like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn) to be exported and used in another, making deployment and interoperability easier.

---

## 1. Why ONNX?

- **Interoperability:** Move models between frameworks and platforms (e.g., train in PyTorch, deploy in C++ or on edge devices).
- **Deployment:** Use ONNX models in production environments, including cloud, mobile, and embedded systems.
- **Optimization:** ONNX Runtime can optimize models for speed and efficiency on various hardware (CPU, GPU, FPGA, etc.).

---

## 2. ONNX Model Structure

An ONNX model is stored in a `.onnx` file, which contains:

- The computation graph (layers, operations, connections)
- Model weights and parameters
- Input and output specifications

ONNX uses a protocol buffer (protobuf) format for efficient serialization and portability.

## 3. Exporting a PyTorch Model to ONNX

You can export a trained PyTorch model to ONNX using `torch.onnx.export()`:

```python
import torch
import torch.onnx

# Assume 'model' is your trained PyTorch model
# 'dummy_input' is a tensor with the same shape as your model's input

torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx", 
                  input_names=['input'], output_names=['output'], 
                  opset_version=11)
```

- `dummy_input` is required to trace the model's computation graph.
- `opset_version` specifies the ONNX operator set (version 11 is widely supported).

---

## 4. Loading and Running ONNX Models

ONNX models can be loaded and run using ONNX Runtime:

```python
import onnxruntime as ort

session = ort.InferenceSession("model.onnx")
inputs = {session.get_inputs()[0].name: input_array}
outputs = session.run(None, inputs)
```

- ONNX Runtime supports fast inference on CPU, GPU, and other hardware.
- You can use ONNX models in Python, C++, Java, and more.

---

## 5. Supported Frameworks and Tools

- **PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn:** Can export models to ONNX.
- **ONNX Runtime:** For fast, cross-platform inference.
- **Converters:** Tools exist to convert models from other formats (e.g., CoreML, XGBoost) to ONNX.

## 6. Limitations and Considerations

---

## 7. Example Workflow

1. Train a model in PyTorch.
2. Export to ONNX with `torch.onnx.export()`.
3. Load and run the model in ONNX Runtime for fast inference.
4. Deploy the ONNX model to cloud, mobile, or edge devices.
